KNOWN:
-When scaling character movement, horizontal moving platforms don't move you correctly. 
> This is because the movement is multiplied by scale, which is not happening on the server. Should be an easy fix.
-When the client can't make the tic in time, it doesn't move correctly on moving platforms and tends to jitter.
>Moving average would almost certainly fix this. I tested it by failing at a server/client tic rate of 4, then trying again with my client tic rate at 8 and it went fine.
FIXED:
- Character falls through floor while resizing or moving window.
- Occasionally, the program appears to deadlock upon opening up the window.
- Player experiences noticable delay. The server is receiving information in realtime and sending out out just as fast.
So the problem lies in the fact that the client thread takes too long to receive information at startup.
> This turned out to be caused by the fact that client needed to keep going all the time,
> But the server was too slow to bind the socket, which caused client to have to wait
> So by making the client bind the socket, it wasn't slowed down anymore and didn't cause delay.
- Pressing jump and then quickly resizing or moving the window causes the player's jump to last much longer than intended.
- Character jitters around on moving platforms, particularly vertical moving platforms. So many different things cause this.
- Character moves by double what it's supposed to when the platform changes direction. Possibly related to the above.
> The three above were all fixed by reorganizing my threads and the flow of the game.
