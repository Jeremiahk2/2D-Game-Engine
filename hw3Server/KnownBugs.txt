KNOWN:
- Pressing jump and then quickly resizing or moving the window causes the player's jump to last much longer than intended.
- Player experiences noticable delay. The server is receiving information in realtime and sending out out just as fast.
So the problem lies in the fact that the client thread takes too long to receive information at startup.

FIXED:
- Character falls through floor while resizing or moving window.
- Occasionally, the program appears to deadlock upon opening up the window.
