Project completed entirely individually during CSC 481 at NCSU.
To run latest version, import the file into Visual Studio 2019. 
NOTE: Latest version is NOT supported for VS 2022 or later.
See readme instructions for individual projects in each folder.

This project received a perfect score of 100 for each part of the assignment. Every line of code was written by me.

##Homeworks

The homeworks folder is a collection of several milestones towards creating the game engine.

Homework One: Homework one is not included as it was completed on a Linux environment.

Homework Two: Homework two is included and shows my understanding of PUB-SUB and REQ-REP networking models as well as threading and synchronization techniques (at the time).
It also demonstrates my ability to handle time and bind a program to time rather than the user's computer power. This provides a smoother and more streamlined experience.

Homework Three: Homework three builds on homework two by creating a Game Object Model which was designed by me. It demonstrates my knowledge of C++ topics like multiple inheritance, dynamic casting, etc.

Homework Four: Homework four  builds off of previous homeworks and adds in an Event Management System, which registeres, queues, and then handles events. This makes threading easier to synchronize
and also makes handling the order and timing of events easier to manage for the developer.

Homework five: Homework five is the final homework where scripting integration is introduced. Support for JavaScript injection to make future development and use of this engine easier and quicker.

##Games

The games folder contains games that were made using this engine. Currently I have put in a Snake game as an example of what this engine can do with only a few hours of programming.
Future games made with this engine will be added to this folder.

Note: Development has stopped due to holidays and schoolwork, but future development is planned. Namely making the scripting more seamless and integrated into the rest of the engine.
Also, the earliest version of this project is not available here as it was done on a different environment (WSL) rather than Windows and VS Studio.
