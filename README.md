This project received a perfect score of 100 for each part of the assignment. Every line of code was written by me.

## ****Homeworks****

The homeworks folder is a collection of several milestones towards creating the game engine.

Homework One: Homework one is not included as it was completed on a Linux environment.

Homework Two: Homework two is included and shows my understanding of PUB-SUB and REQ-REP networking models as well as threading and synchronization techniques (at the time).
It also demonstrates my ability to handle time and bind a program to time rather than the user's computer power. This provides a smoother and more streamlined experience.

Homework Three: Homework three builds on homework two by creating a Game Object Model which was designed by me. It demonstrates my knowledge of C++ topics like multiple inheritance, dynamic casting, etc.

Homework Four: Homework four  builds off of previous homeworks and adds in an Event Management System, which registeres, queues, and then handles events. This makes threading easier to synchronize
and also makes handling the order and timing of events easier to manage for the developer.

Homework five: Homework five is the final homework where scripting integration is introduced. Support for JavaScript injection to make future development and use of this engine easier and quicker.

## ****Games****

I put a Snake game I made using this engine in the games folder, as a demonstration of a game that can be made with this engine. I've also used this engine to make a 2D platformer, and a top-down tile-based game. To use this game engine, I suggest working off the template I put in this folder.
