Project completed entirely individually during CSC 481 at NCSU.
To run latest version, import the file into Visual Studio 2019. 
NOTE: Latest version is NOT supported for VS 2022 or later.
See readme instructions for individual projects in each folder.

This project received a perfect score of 100 for each part of the assignment. Every line of code was written by me.

Note: Development has stopped due to holidays and schoolwork, but future development is planned. Namely making the scripting more seamless and integrated into the rest of the engine.
Also, the earliest version of this project is not available here as it was done on a different environment (WSL) rather than Windows and VS Studio.
